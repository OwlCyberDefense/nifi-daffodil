<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    This processor uses Daffodil and a user-specified DFDL schema to parse data into an XML or JSON representation,
    called the DFDL infoset. Upon a successful parse of the incoming FlowFile, the resulting infoset is
    transferred to the <i>success</i> Relationship. Upon a failed parse, the incoming FlowFile is transferred
    to the <i>failure</i> Relationship.
</p>
<h3>Daffodil and DFDL</h3>
<p>
    <a href="https://daffodil.apache.org">Apache Daffodil</a>
    is the open source implementation of the
    <a href="https://www.ogf.org/ogf/doku.php/standards/dfdl/dfdl">Data Format Description Language (DFDL)</a>. DFDL
    is a language capable of describing many data formats, including textual and binary, commercial
    record-oriented, scientific and numeric, modern and legacy, and many industry standards. It leverages XML
    technology and concepts, using a subset of W3C XML schema type system and annotations to describe such
    data. Daffodil uses this data description to "parse" data into an XML or JSON representation of the data. This
    allows one to take advantage of the many XML and JSON technologies (e.g. XQuery, XPath, XSLT) to ingest, validate,
    and manipulate complex data formats. Daffodil can also use this data description to "unparse", or
    serialize, the XML or JSON representation back to the original data format.
</p>
<p>
    Publicly available DFDL schemas are available on the <a href="https://github.com/DFDLSchemas">DFDL Schemas github</a>.
</p>
<h2>Plugins and Schemas</h2>
<p>
    <p>
    The <tt>Plugins and Schemas</tt> property is a comma separated list of paths to files and/or directories that the
    processor can use to find Daffodil plugins and schemas.
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Plugins</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
            Some DFDL schemas may require the use of plugins, such as layers, user defined functions, or custom
            character encodings. To make these available to NiFi Daffodil processors, these plugins can be compiled to
            jars, and paths to the jars or parent directory may be added to the <tt>Plugins and Schemas</tt> property. For
            example, if all Daffodil plugins are in the <tt>/usr/share/nifi-daffodil/plugins/</tt> directory, you might
            set the property to the following:
            </p>

            <pre>
            Plugins and Schemas: /usr/share/nifi-daffodil/plugins/</pre>
        </dd>
        <dt>Schemas</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
            The <tt>DFDL Schema File</tt> property is used to define the path to a schema to be compiled, or a saved
            parser to reload if <tt>Pre-compiled schema</tt> is true. However, in some cases it may be more convenient
            to provide the schema as a path inside a jar, or as just a filename instead of a full path. The <tt>Plugins
            and Schemas</tt> property can be used for this purpose.
            </p>

            <p>
            If a schema (or saved parser) is defined in a jar, then add the jar to the <tt>Plugins and Schemas</tt>
            property (either as a path to the directory containing the jar or a path to the jar itself), and set the
            <tt>DFDL Schema File</tt> property to the <i>absolute path</i> to the schema <i>inside</i> the jar. For
            example, if a jar at <tt>/usr/share/nifi-daffodil/schemas/dfdl-foo.jar</tt> contains a DFDL schema file
            called <tt>com/example/foo.dfdl.xsd</tt>, you might configure the following:
            </p>

            <pre>
            DFDL Schema File: /com/example/foo.dfdl.xsd
            Plugins and Schemas: /usr/share/nifi-daffodil/schemas/</pre>

            <p>
            If a schema (or saved parser) is not in a jar, then add the file to the <tt>Plugins and Schemas</tt>
            property (either as a path to the directory containing the file or a path to the file itself) and set the
            <tt>DFDL Schema File</tt> property to just the file name. For example, if a saved parser is at
            <tt>/usr/share/nifi-daffodil/saved-parsers/foo.bin</tt>, you might configure the following:
            </p>

            <pre>
            DFDL Schema File: foo.bin
            Plugins and Schemas: /usr/share/nifi-daffodil/saved-parsers/
            Pre-compiled Schema: true</pre>
        </dd>
    </dl>
</p>
<h2>Compiled DFDL Schema Cache</h2>
<p>
    Before a FlowFile can be parsed or unparsed, Daffodil first compiles the DFDL schema to an internal data
    structure. This compilation can be relatively slow, so once a schema is compiled it is cached inside this
    NiFi processor for rapid reuse. The following properties are provided to control how this cache is
    maintained:
    <dl>
        <dt>Cache Size</dt>
        <dd>
            Defines the maximum number of DFDL schemas that can be compiled and saved for rapid reuse from the
            cache. To avoid compilation, it is recommended that this value be larger than the expected number
            of possible DFDL schemas. Setting this value to 0 disables the cache, though this is not
            recommended.
        </dd>
        <dt>Cache TTL after last access</dt>
        <dd>
            Defines the cache time-to-live, or how long to keep an unused compiled DFDL schemas in the cache. To avoid
            compilation, it is recommended that this should be larger than the amount of time it is expected
            for a DFDL schema to be unused.
        </dd>
    </dl>
